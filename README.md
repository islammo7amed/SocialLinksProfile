# Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile
This is my solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ) from Frontend Mentor.  
The challenge was to build a simple profile card that displays an avatar, name, location, description, and social links.
